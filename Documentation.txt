add_question()
PRE:
must have $_POST variables for question, answer, fake1, fake2, fake3, subject
(this could be done as parameters, but we have it on the same page as form, so it is unneeded)
user must be logged in, this ensures $_SESSION['login'] is set

updates mysql database table 368_questions to contain all information
information=(question, answer, fake1, fake2, fake3, author, subject, id(auto_inc))
RETURN:
none.

getQuestion($subject, $amountOfQuestions)
PRE:

  or to how many questions there are of that subject in database.
